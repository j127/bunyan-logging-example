# A Quick Example of Logging in Bunyan (Node.js)

Installing it: clone the repo and run `npm i`

Running it:

1. `npm start` to run the program. It just prints out human readable log.
2. `npm run logs:errors` to view the human readable `warn`/`error` logs (omitting the `info` level)
3. `npm run logs:raw` to view all the raw logs in JSON format.

Type `npm run` to see a list of scripts.
